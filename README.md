# Analyzing the questioning tendencies of Members of Parliament
***
This assignment aims to answer the research question: 

“Oral and written questions allow Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons to query the government and its ministers on their work (see here). What, if any, characteristics and factors discriminate MPs who tend to ask questions about economic issues from MPs who tend to ask questions about health and welfare issues?”

The ukparliament.sqlite file contains the question tibble (oral and written questions concerning economic and health and welfare issues in 2023), as well as all data required for visualizaiton.
